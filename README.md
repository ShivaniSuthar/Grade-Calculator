# Grade-Calculator
## Project Summary:
I programmed a grade calculator using a dataframe of student assignment grades such as lab scores, test scores, etc. and a course syllabus to calculate various  grade components such as lateness penalties, a studentâ€™s overall grade, and the proportion of students in the class who received a certain grade.

Dataframe manipulation, use of basic Pandas and NumPy functions, and data cleaning were the primary methods used in this project.

This project was completed in Jupyter Notebook and testing was done through doctests.
